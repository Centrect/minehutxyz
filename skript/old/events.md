# Events

## OVERVIEW & EXAMPLE

Events are called when something happens. So when a player clicks on something, takes damage, dies, when a mob does something, or even when the environment does something else completely independent of entity interaction. This will allow you to make something happen when something else happens. For example:

```vb
on connect:
    kick player
```

## INDENTATION

All events must follow the rules of indentation. Read all about indentation [here](indentation.md).

## ALL EVENTS

All events can be found [here](http://de.njol.ch/projects/skript/doc/events), the njol documentation.
