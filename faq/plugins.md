## INSTALLING PLUGINS

Firstly, head over to the **Plugins** section on the File Manager. Now comes the fun part; find the plugins you want to install to make your server better. There are useful plugins such as WorldEdit, or fun plugins such as uSkyBlock. Click the plugin you want to install, and click the **Install** button.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The free plan only allows you to have a max of **12 plugins** installed at one time.
{% endhint %}

## RESTARTING YOUR SERVER

Secondly, click the large **Restart** button at the top of your File Manager to restart your server. This is a requirement. Now you can join your server, and the selected plugins will be installed.
