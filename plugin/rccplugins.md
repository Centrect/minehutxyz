# RECOMMENDED PLUGINS

### _This tutorial was submitted by Lukas. Find out how you can submit a tutorial_ [_here_](../contribute.md)_._

### Base Plugin

Almost every server, from kitpvp to survival to skygens and etc. will need this plugin: **EssentialsX**. This all in one plugin is at the heart of every server and simplifies commands, adds permissions, lets you moniter stats, and more. (p.s. if you want to use normal minecraft commands add `/minecraft:` before your command)

### Other great plugins

These are a few plugins I thought would be noteworthy to shre when creating a server:
- `World Edit` WorldEdit is an easy-to-use in-game world editor for Minecraft, supporting both single player and multiplayer. Learn more [here](https://minehut.xyz/plugin/worldedit).
- `World Guard` Create zones in your world that only permit mods or certain players from building within Set additional game rules on your server (deny wither block damage, falling damage, etc.). Learn more abou  worldguard [here](https://minehut.xyz/plugin/worldguard).
- `Core Protect` CoreProtect is a fast, efficient, data logging and anti-griefing tool. Rollback and restore any amount of damage. Learn more about it [here](https://minehut.xyz/plugin/coreprotect).
- `Essentials Chat` Lets you farmat your chat and makes it look really nice! Learn more about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FU_tK-zYYb4). (Video from minehut about how to set it up).
- `Multiverse` Is a complete world management solution, with other plugins like Portals or Inventory. Learn more [here](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core).
- `Skript and its addons` This is a plugin that allows you to customize Minecraft's mechanics with simple scripts written in plain English sentences. You can easily create complex custom commands, triggers that execute effects under certain conditions, and scripts that just run periodically - all without having to know even the slightest bit about programming! The (hopefully) intuitive language has the advantage that you don't even need to learn much to be able to use Skript.
- `Vualt` Dependancy for a lot of plugins. Highley recommend you install it :)

## SPECIFIC PLUGIN CATGORIES

### PERMISSIONS PLUGINS

There are a lot of permission plugins on minehut, but only two that I would consider people use: Luckperms and PermissionsEX. These allow you to specify perms for groups or players, so that you don't have to op all your staff.
- `Lukeperms` Easier for beginners, because of the online editor. The ingame commands are also very similar to permissionEX in that sense, but the online editor allows mass rank management and rank creation. Its also nice to see everything visually. Read more about luckperms [here](https://minehut.xyz/plugin/lp).
- `PermissionEX` is another well known permission plugin. While it dosen't have the fancy online editor, pex is known for "just working." Read more about hot to use pex [here](https://minehut.xyz/plugin/pex).

### 1.8 PvP

By far, the best 1.8 PvP plugin is `OldCombatMechanics`. This is the one with less bugs/issues. Not that if your uninstalling it, it can still leave your server on 1.8 pvp, so be sure to install `OCM Fixer` as well (if its updated :eyes:)

### Version Support

The best plugins for multiversion supoport is `Viaversion`, `ViaBackwards`, and `ViaRewind`. These are much better then protocall support for numerous reasons including lag prevention, block fixing, and less overall bugs. This is also the once minehut uses. (Note that this plugin is 3 plugins, not 1 like protocall. If you have to obey the 12 plugin limit, use protocall support instead)

## SERVER TYPE PLUGINS
Please note that inlike the other sections, this is primarily based on my opinion.

### SURVIVAL SERVER PLUGINS

Most SMP's don't need many plugins, and can be preatty "lightweight" compared to minigame servers. BUT, that isn't to day you don't need any:
- `Coreprotect` A block management tool that lets you rollback greifing, find who placed/broke blocks, and even logs chests!
- `Worldedit` Great for taking down greifed buildings lag machines

### PvP Servers
- `Old Combat Mechanics` Back to 1.8 pvp.
- `Version Support` Read more about viaversion above.
- `Inventory Rollback` Roll back players inventorys. Very helpful for pvp servers where people lose an item in progression.
- `Item editor` Lets admins create items wth over the top enchatments and cool names.

### Minigame Servers
- `Item editor` Lets admins create items wth over the top enchatments and cool names.
- `Holographic Displays` Create floating text around your server
