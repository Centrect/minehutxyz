# RECOMMENDED PLUGINS

### _This tutorial was submitted by Lukas. Find out how you can submit a tutorial_ [_here_](../contribute.md)_._

##Base Plugins

Almost every server, from kitpvp to survival to skygens and etc. will need this plugin: **EssentialsX**. This all in one plugin is at the heart of every server and simplifies commands, adds permissions, lets you moniter stats, and more. (p.s. if you want to use normal minecraft commands add `/minecraft:` before your command)

## SPECIFIC PLUGIN CATGORIES

### PERMISSIONS PLUGINS

There are a lot of permission plugins on minehut, but only two that I would consider people use: Luckperms and PermissionsEX. These allow you to specify perms for groups or players, so that you don't have to op all your staff.
- `Lukeperms` Easier for beginners, because of the online editor. The ingame commands are also very similar to permissionEX in that sense, but the online editor allows mass rank management and rank creation. Its also nice to see everything visually. Read more about luckperms [here](https://minehut.xyz/plugin/lp).
- `PermissionEX` is another well known permission plugin. While it dosen't have the fancy online editor, pex is known for "just working." Read more about hot to use pex [here](https://minehut.xyz/plugin/pex).

### 1.8 PvP

By far, the best 1.8 PvP plugin is `OldCombatMechanics`. This is the one with less bugs/issues. Not that if your uninstalling it, it can still leave your server on 1.8 pvp, so be sure to install `OCM Fixer` as well (if its updated :eyes:)

## SERVER TYPE PLUGINS

### SURVIVAL SERVER PLUGINS

Most SMP's don't need many plugins, and can be preatty "lightweight" compared to minigame servers. BUT, that isn't to day you don't need any:
- `Coreprotect` A block management tool that lets you rollback greifing, find who placed/broke blocks, and even logs chests!
- `Worldedit` Great for taking down greifed buildings lag machines
